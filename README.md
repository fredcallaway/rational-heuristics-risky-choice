# Automatically Deriving Resource-Rational Heuristics for Risky Choice

This repository contains code and data for the analyses for "Automatically Deriving Resource-Rational Heuristics for Risky Choice", 
which is currently under review ([preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/mg7dn)).

Model simulations can be generated by running `julia -p auto run_model.jl` in the julia/ directory. Note that this takes a long time even on a server with many cores.

Figures and statistical results can be generated by running `python3 main.py` in the python/ directory. The "risky-choice" virtual environment can be created by running `conda env create -f environment.yml` in the python/env/ directory.
