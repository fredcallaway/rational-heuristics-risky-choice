# Discovering Rational Heuristics for Risky Choice

This repository contains code and data for the analyses for "Discovering Rational Heuristics for Risky Choice", which is currently under review (todo: add preprint link)

Model simulations can be generated by running `julia -p auto run_model.jl` in the julia/ directory. Note that this takes a long time even on a server with many cores.

TODO: describe python process
