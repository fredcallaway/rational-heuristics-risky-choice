# Discovering Rational Heuristics for Risky Choice

This repository contains code and data for the analyses for "Discovering Rational Heuristics for Risky Choice", 
which is currently under review ([preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/mg7dn)).

Model simulations can be generated by running `julia -p auto run_model.jl` in the julia/ directory. Note that this takes a long time even on a server with many cores.

Instructions for processing the data and producing figures and statistical analyses found in the manuscript can be found in strategy_dicovery.ipynb
